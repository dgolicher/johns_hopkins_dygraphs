# Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dygraphs

Run the app here:

https://dgolicher.shinyapps.io/Johns_hopkins_dygraphs/

The shiny app runs by scraping data from 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series

Results are then displayed mainly through use of the dygraphs package in R

No documentation nor anotation at present. Some of the code involves correcting errors in order to merge the JsHs data with World Development Indicators data in order to use population estimates.
